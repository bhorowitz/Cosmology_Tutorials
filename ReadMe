Feel free to use these for classroom use! Just let me know how it went or if you encountered any problems.

To do...

1) Friedmann Equation Activity (expansion on Hubble Diagram activity?)
2) Chisquared and Likelihood Functions
3) Monte Carlo Activity (solve for components of Friedmann Equations activity?)
4) Powerspectra Activity
5) Orbits! Three body interactions
6) Perturbation Theory

More obscure?
1) Gravitational Lensing Activity (Shear?)
2) Cross Correlations and Bias
3) Boltzmann Equation Activity?
4) Halo Occupancy Distributions?
5) Bayronic Accoustic Oscillations
