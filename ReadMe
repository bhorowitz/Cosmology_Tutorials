Feel free to use these for classroom use! Just let me know how it went or if you encountered any problems.

To do...

1) Friedmann Equation Activity (expansion on Hubble Diagram activity?)
2) Monte Carlo Activity (solve for components of Friedmann Equations activity?)
3) Powerspectra Activity
4) Gravitational Lensing Activity (Shear?)
5) Cross Correlations and Bias
6) Boltzmann Equation Activity?
7) Halo Occupancy Distributions?
